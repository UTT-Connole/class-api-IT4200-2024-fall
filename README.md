## Commit instructions for developers
A GitHub action has been created for automatic semantic version tagging using this repository: [Github tag with sematic versioning](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-tag-with-semantic-versioning). It uses [Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines) as commit message guidelines.

Here is an example of the release type that will be done based on a commit messages:

| Commit message                                                                                                                                                                                   | Release type  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| `fix(pencil): stop graphite breaking when too much pressure applied`                                                                                                                             | Patch Release |
| `feat(pencil): add 'graphiteWidth' option`                                                                                                                                                       | Minor Release |
| `perf(pencil): remove graphiteWidth option`<br><br>`BREAKING CHANGE: The graphiteWidth option has been removed.`<br>`The default graphite width of 10mm is always used for performance reasons.` | Major Release |

If no commit message contains any information, then **default_bump** (currently set to minor) will be used.
