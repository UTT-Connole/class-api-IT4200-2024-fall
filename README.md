# Welcome to the class API!

We will be using this repo to create an API for our entire class. We will use Flask for this application and each member of the class will work within this single repo.

# How to run and get to your endpoint

To get to your endpoint go to the folder the app is in in a terminal (EX. class-api-IT4200-2024-fall) and run the command “python3 -m flask run”, this will start the server. From there navigate to the url and your desired endpoint “http://127.0.0.1:5000/calc” for calculator for example.
